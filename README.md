# 🚀 DSA Preparation Journey in Java 🚀 

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** preparation repository! This repository is dedicated to solving DSA problems using **Java**. Each problem is categorized by patterns such as **Two Pointers**, **Hashmap**, **Sliding Window**, and more. My goal is to systematically improve my problem-solving skills while providing clear and efficient solutions for others to learn from.

## 🌟 About the Repository

This repository is a collection of my **Java-based** solutions to various DSA problems. Each solution is written in clean, readable, and efficient Java code, with comments explaining the logic where necessary. Problems are grouped by patterns, making it easier to understand and practice specific techniques.

I hope this repository will not only help me track my progress but also assist others who are preparing for technical interviews or improving their DSA skills.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on problem-solving patterns. Below is an overview of the folder structure:

```
DSA/
├── Two-Pointer/               # Solutions using the Two Pointer technique
│   ├── Easy                   # Easy Example problem solved using Two Pointers
│   ├── Medium                 # Medium Example problem solved using Two Pointers
│   └── Hard                   # Hard Example problem solved using Two Pointers
│   └── README.md              # Explanation of the Two Pointer pattern
├── Hashmap/                   # Solutions using Hashmaps
│   ├── Easy                   # Easy Example problem solved using Hashmap pattern
│   ├── Medium                 # Medium Example problem solved using Hashmap pattern
│   └── Hard                   # Hard Example problem solved using Hashmap pattern
│   └── README.md              # Explanation of the Hashmap pattern
├── Sliding-Window/            # Solutions using the Sliding Window technique
│   ├── Easy                   # Easy Example problem solved using Sliding Window pattern
│   ├── Medium                 # Medium Example problem solved using Sliding Window pattern
│   └── Hard                   # Hard Example problem solved using Sliding Window pattern
│   └── README.md              # Explanation of the Sliding Window pattern
├── Backtracking/              # Solutions using Backtracking
├── Dynamic-Programming/       # Solutions using Dynamic Programming
├── Graphs/                    # Solutions related to Graphs
└── README.md                  # This file
```

Each folder contains:
- Problem files (e.g., `Problem1.java`, `Problem2.java`)
- A `README.md` file explaining the pattern and its applications.
