# üéØ Two Pointers Pattern

The **Two Pointers** technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve a wide range of problems efficiently. This pattern involves using two pointers (or indices) to traverse or manipulate data structures like arrays, strings, or linked lists. By strategically moving these pointers, we can reduce time complexity and simplify solutions.

This folder contains Java-based solutions to problems that are commonly solved using the **Two Pointers** technique. Each solution is well-commented and optimized for clarity and efficiency.

## üß† What is the Two Pointers Technique?

The **Two Pointers** technique involves using two references (pointers) to iterate through a data structure. These pointers can move in the same direction or opposite directions, depending on the problem. The technique is especially useful for:

- **Searching pairs**: Finding elements that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., sum equals a target).
- **Sliding windows**: Solving subarray or substring problems.
- **Sorting-related problems**: Optimizing operations on sorted arrays.

### Example:
Given a sorted array, find two numbers whose sum equals a target value.

```java
int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left, right};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++; // Move left pointer to increase the sum
        } else {
            right--; // Move right pointer to decrease the sum
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1}; // No solution found
}
```

## üîç Why Use Two Pointers?

- **Efficiency**: Reduces time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n) for many problems.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies logic by avoiding nested loops.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to a wide range of problems, including arrays, strings, and linked lists.
